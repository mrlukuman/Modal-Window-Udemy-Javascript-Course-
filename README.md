# Modal-Window-Udemy-Javascript-Course-
I created this by following a course on Udemy.
In this project, I learnt:
1. How to work with Html classes. Specifically, I learnt how to remove, add and check the existence of classes in an html file by using Javascript to interact with the DOM.
2. I learnt how to work with event handler fuctions using 'addEventLister' method. I implemented this by listening to 'keydown' and 'click' events.
3. I also learn about how other events other than 'keydown' and 'click' work. Example, 'keypress', 'keyup', 'copy', etc. 
4. I also practiced on refactoring my code by implementing the DRY(dont repeat yourself) method.
